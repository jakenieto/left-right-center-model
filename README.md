**Gameplay**
Each player receives at least 3 chips. Players take it in turn to roll three six-sided dice, 
each of which is marked with "L", "C", "R" on one side, and a single dot on the three remaining sides. 
For each "L" or "R" thrown, the player must pass one chip to the player to their left or right, respectively. 
A "C" indicates a chip to the center (pot). A dot has no effect.

If a player has fewer than three chips left, they are still in the game but their number of chips 
is the number of dice they roll on their turn, rather than rolling all three. When a player has zero chips, 
they pass the dice on their turn, but may receive chips from others and take their next turn accordingly. 
The player who does not receive chips after two passes is out of the game. The winner is the last player with chips left.
